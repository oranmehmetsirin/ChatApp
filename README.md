# ChatApp

A Chat Application.

The application allows you to chat by creating a database with the help of Firebase.

It allows different users to log in with the help of Google - or another application - without creating a username and password, to log in to an existing room, or to chat by creating a new room.

-Correspondences are saved in the encoded Firebase database.-

In the application, the config.js file and the Firebase folder to which it is linked have been removed from Github because they contain API keys.

You can create the file in question with the help of Firebase documents and add different applications for login.

Firebase and SCSS were used in the project created with the collaboration of Vite-React.

You can access the visual of the project below.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
